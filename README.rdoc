= rollout

Conditionally roll out features with redis.

== Install it

  gem install rollout

== How it works

Initialize a rollout object. I assign it to a global var.

  $redis   = Redis.new
  $rollout = Rollout.new($redis)

Check whether a feature is active for a particular user:
  
  $rollout.active?(:chat, User.first) # => true/false

You can activate features using a number of different mechanisms.

== Groups

Rollout ships with one group by default: "all", which does exactly what it sounds like. 

You can activate the all group for the chat feature like this:

  $rollout.activate_group(:chat, :all)

You might also want to define your own groups. We have one for our caretakers:

  $rollout.define_group(:caretakers) do |user|
    user.caretaker?
  end

You can activate multiple groups per feature.

Deactivate groups like this:

  $rollout.deactivate_group(:chat, :all)

== Specific Users

You might want to let a specific user into a beta test or something. If that user isn't part of an existing group, you can let them in specifically:
  
  $rollout.activate_user(:chat, @user)

Deactivate them like this:

  $rollout.deactivate_user(:chat, @user)

== User Percentages

If you're rolling out a new feature, you might want to test the waters by slowly letting in a percentage of your users.

  $rollout.activate_percentage(:chat, 20)

The algorithm for determining which users get let in is this:

  user.id % 10 < percentage / 10

So, for 20%, users 0, 1, 10, 11, 20, 21, etc would be allowed in. Those users would remain in as the percentage increases.

Deactivate all percentages like this:

  $rollout.deactivate_percentage(:chat)

== Feature is broken

Deactivate everybody at once:

  $rollout.deactivate_all(:chat)

For many of our features, we keep track of error rates using redis, and deactivate them automatically when a threshold is reached to prevent service failures from cascading. See http://github.com/jamesgolick/degrade for the failure detection code.

== Namespacing

Rollout separates its keys from other keys on the Redis server using the "feature" keyspace.

You can namespace keys further to support multiple environments by using the http://github.com/defunkt/redis-namespace gem.

  $ns = Redis::Namespace.new(Rails.env, :redis => $redis)
  $rollout = Rollout.new($ns)
  $rollout.activate_group(:chat, :all)
  
This example would use the "development:feature:chat:groups" key.
